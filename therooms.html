          <li><h2>About:</h2>The rooms is a mobile first web application that allows users to find Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in their area when they need it the most.</li>
          <li><h2>Objective:</h2>The primary objective was to create an application that can allow users to find meetings in their area as soon as possible. The objective for the user interface was to use a minimalistic design that allows users to navigate the app with ease.  The color scheme is based on a deep blue that is commonly associated with Alcoholics Anonymous</li>
          <li><h2>Persona:</h2>The user experience was based on a persona created to help understand the needs of the user and how to best serve them.</li>
          <div class="derek"><img src="images/Derek S..png" alt=""></div>
          <li><h2>Process:</h2>The quick find button was created to allow users to find close by meetings as soon as possible.  When the user clicks on the quick find button it will automatically generate the next five meetings with in 10 miles.  There is also a day selector that allows users to find meetings on a specific day. Another feature added is the sobriety counter.  The counter allows users to enter in their sobriety date and calculate the number of days they have been sober.  It's a great way to keep track of progress and stay motivated!</li>
