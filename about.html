      <div class="personal-info">
        <p>My name is Hiter Harris and I am a designer and developer working in front end development.  I’m a former NCAA track & field athlete and member of the USA bobsled team.<br><br>I’m passionate about self improvement whether it’s in my career, education, or health.  I enjoy waking up each day with the opportunity to get better at something.<br><br>I want to continue to use the skills I’ve learned to design and build new projects for others to use to make their lives easier.</p>
        <p>I’m currently a front end developer at Monkey Bread Technologies in Raleigh, NC working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress.  I’ve built several projects for design companies and clients using these skills as well as several applications using solely JavaScript.  Recently, I’ve been working with JavaScript libraries like React and React Native to build these applications. <br><br> Responsive web design is a vital part of my design and development process given the necessity to access websites and applications on a variety of devices and screen sizes. I have experience practicing responsive web design on a majority of my projects creating dynamic changes to website appearance and adapting to varying design and development requirements. <br><br> While my current position is focused on development, I do have an extensive background with design.  I have experience with design skills such as sketching, wire framing, and building mockups and prototypes.  The tools I use for design include Sketch, PhotoShop, Axure, and InVision.  I’ve worked with designers as a developer and I've worked with developers as a designer, so I’m very flexible playing any role along the design and development process and being able to communicate with my teammates and colleagues along the way.  I have a very efficient design process when working on projects with which I've had a lot of success.  My process is very organized and methodic while prioritizing deadlines and communication with my team.</p>
