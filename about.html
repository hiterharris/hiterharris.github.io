      <p>I’m front end engineer currently working primarily with React. I have experience with other technologies like
        Node, GraphQL, React Native, HTML, CSS, jQuery, as well as a background in design. I moved to Charlotte to work
        as a front end engineer at Levvel, an IT consulting company in town, working with React and GraphQL. While at
        Levvel, I analyzed large code bases, wrote clean, efficient code, and worked with multiple team members in an
        Agile environment. I also learned new technologies on the fly and was able to apply them to the project under a
        time crunch.</p>
      <p>At Levvel, I worked on projects with large code bases, multiple team members, and skills I was both familiar
        and unfamiliar with, I analyzed large code bases and wrote clean, efficient code following best practices that
        were consistent with the project as a whole. I had detailed code reviews where I learned how to improve my code
        to be more efficient. One challenge I enjoyed while working at Levvel was learning new skills and applying them
        on the job. One project I worked on used GraphQL to access data from our API, a technology I had never used. I
        was able to use different resources at my disposal to learn how to use it and apply it to my project. I then
        used my new skills to write queries and mutations to access and update our database and apply it to the
        application.
        <br><br>
        Specifically, I worked on projects using React for the front end and Node/Express for the back end. I also used
        Apollo Client and GraphQL to fetch data from our API to access and update our database. These projects included
        a web application for the company’s intranet that allows employees to nominate and vote for co-workers based on
        how they exemplify Levvel’s core values. My work focused on implementing the nomination flow, voter flow, and
        admin page.</p>
