        <p>I'm a full stack web developer with a background in athletics and training.  I was a NCAA student-athlete at Wake Forest University and a member of the United States Bobsled Team.  I transitioned into web development in 2016 and working primarily as a front end developer.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m currently working as a full stack developer using React on the front end with Node and Express on the back end. I also work with several relational databases such as Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB.  I moved to Charlotte to work as a front end engineer at Levvel.io working with React and GraphQL. While at Levvel, I analyzed large code bases, wrote clean, efficient code, and worked with multiple team members in an agile environment. I also learned new technologies on the fly and was able to apply them to the project under a time crunch.</p>
        <p>At Levvel, I worked on projects with large code bases, multiple team members, and skills I was both familiar and unfamiliar with.  I analyzed large code bases and wrote efficient code following best practices that were consistent with the project as a whole. I had detailed code reviews where I learned how to improve my code to be more efficient.</p>
        <p>While enrolled at Lambda School, I gained more experience with front end and back end technologies and applied them to larger team projects.  One project includes The Garden of Knowledge, a student management system for an English language school in Bahrain.</p>
