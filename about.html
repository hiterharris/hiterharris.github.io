        <p>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer working with React on the front end and Node on the back end.  I also have worked with several relational databases such as Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB and used these skills to build full stack web applications as a developer at Levvel.io and Lambda School. I moved to Charlotte to work as a front end engineer at Levvel, an IT consulting company in town, working with React and GraphQL. While at Levvel, I analyzed large code bases, wrote clean, efficient code, and worked with multiple team members in an Agile environment. I also learned new technologies on the fly and was able to apply them to the project under a time crunch.</p>
        <p>At Levvel, I worked on projects with large code bases, multiple team members, and skills I was both familiar and unfamiliar with, I analyzed large code bases and wrote clean, efficient code following best practices that were consistent with the project as a whole. I had detailed code reviews where I learned how to improve my code to be more efficient. One challenge I enjoyed while working at Levvel was learning new skills and applying them on the job. One project I worked on used GraphQL to access data from our API, a technology I had never used. I was able to use different resources at my disposal to learn how to use it and apply it to my project. I then used my new skills to write queries and mutations to access and update our database and apply it to the application.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working with both front end and back end technologies building APIs, databases, and full scale front end applications to access back end servers and persist data. One project I recently worked on was a student management system for an English language school in Bahrain.  Skills used include: React, Redux, React-Hook-Form, Node.js, Express, Postgres</p>
